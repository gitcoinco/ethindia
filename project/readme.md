# ConvergeProtocol

- Converge Protocol is a usablity and scalability solution for Ethereum

- Converge is a pluggable features for wallets and dapps which help create batches/bundles of transactions.

- It can be used to merging and sending mulitple transactions into a single one.

- Moving Forward, It will be one of the poineer of offchain and plasma data distrbution solution for Ethereum scalablity solutions

# Problems -

- Peoples and organisations have to do token transfer one by one if they want to do mass transfer
- It is a very tedious process and takes a long time depending on number of transactions and network status
- Ethereum is facing scalablity issues and network gets clogged when many transactions comes to the network

# our solution -
- Create a integrable batch transaction sender
- Integrate to all popular wallets - Metamask, Mew etc

# Future plans -
- Make the protocol integrable to Dapps systems
- Introduce off-chain/plasma for transaction batch storage
