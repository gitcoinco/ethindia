# Economic incentive to participate and propose issue for open source development.

## Outline

Open source projects today are controlled by only few developers rest of the volunteers only submit bugs and work on periphery. We propose a voting mechanism for proposing issue and features as well as PR's from relatively new developers if the voters/developers approved the ISSUE, FEATURE , PR etc. it can be taken to next steps. Open source project will create a voting smart contract and provides it with some ETH/BTC as an economic incentive to the fellow developers/voters. In return the amount of ETH will be available to winning side (yes or no)as a reward. Expecting participants to reach an economic equilibrium.

## Example 

For example, if an Open source project git issue offers a reward to voters of 1 ETH in order to be merged or propose a new feature, and in a period of 10 days the voters send a total of 10 ETH, of which 6 ETH went to the Yes vote, the winners get their 6 ETH back plus the 95% of the reward, 0.95 ETH.

In financial terms, winning voters get a 15.8% return on investment voting on the Issue/PR. Losers get their 4 ETH plus 0.05 ETH , receiving a 1,2% return. This return is computed for the voting period of 10 days, which is the period when the project proposal is being voted on by developers/peer.
